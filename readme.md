Make sure the following are installed globally:

`yarn`, `tsc`, and `watch`. (Yarn, TypeScript, and Watch). You should be able to install these globally by Google I'm too lazy 2 do it now. ( oh wait: `sudo npm install -g yarn`, `sudo npm install -g typescript`, and `brew install watch`. If you don't have brew what r u a designer or something? ) 

Scaffolding. It's in everyone's favorite JavaScript super-set, TypeScript. To get things going, run `yarn` and then two terminals, `yarn develop` and `yarn watch`.

SASS -> CSS; TS & TSX -> JS.

E.N.J.O.Y.
